Main -> MOV: executeMVN(cpu, instruction)
MOV -> CPU: checkCondition(cond)
CPU -> CPU: Evaluate condition
CPU --> MOV: Condition result
alt Condition Passed
    MOV -> CPU: setRegister(Rd, ~Oprnd2)
    alt S bit is set and Rd is R15
        MOV -> CPU: setCPSR(cpu.getSPSR(), 0xFFFFFFFF)
        MOV -> Main: SPSR copied to CPSR
    else S bit is set and Rd is not R15
        MOV -> CPU: updateFlags(~Oprnd2)
        MOV -> Main: Flags updated with ~Oprnd2
    end
    MOV -> Main: Register Rd set to ~Oprnd2
else Condition Failed
    MOV -> Main: Condition failed, do not execute
